- *For the time being*, there are no front-facing docs for this beyond docstrings in the code itself 
    - most of which do not exist yet

## Installing
**Python 3.7 or higher is suggested**

This project will likely never be put on PyPI, so you'll have to install the development version, from this repo.

```sh
python -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/diceroll123/neofoodclub.py
```

*Alternatively,*

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/diceroll123/neofoodclub.py
$ cd neofoodclub.py
$ python -m pip install -U .
```
